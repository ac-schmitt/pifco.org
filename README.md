## Mechanics

### RSS Feed

I've overriden the theme template for the rss feed in [layouts/posts/rss.xml](layouts/posts/rss.xml) to get a full content feed.

### Images

Most Images are stored and fetched from imgur.com. Images in the repo are mainly the site icons or part of a stand-alone functionality, like the [quick reference](static-quickref/quickref.html).

All external images which are remixes of original work are smaller than 125 kilobyte in compliance with european and german law. Remixing usually means cropping, adding transparancy or changing the color scheme to match with the site color scheme.

Image dimensions are usually resized and cropped to 960 pixel maximum width or 720 pixel width to fit into the site style. Smaller sizes follow the default width values: 480, 360 or 240 pixel width.

To create an image look that uses the background color of the site, I am using a background layer with color code 494f5c and a foreground layer with HSV-Value or Luminanz mode. I am using this especially for the maps, e.g. [Jadet√§nzer Map Section](https://i.imgur.com/Xkx7hC5.jpg). Location marker is a 16px round pencil with a 5px border around the original "dot".

### Homebrew Maps

I am creating the homebrew maps with [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/de/photo/) using a 48px raster, with a 16px/25% hardness brush for solid walls, 8px/25% for inner walls, 4px/25% for wall fillings, stairs, etc and a 2px/100% hardness brush for the visible raster.

I am still trying different methods for drawing. Mainly, I use my old Wacom Intuos PS but also my surface pen on the Surface Go I'm using as my main private notebook/tablet.
